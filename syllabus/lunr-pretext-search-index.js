You can expect a response within 24 hours on weekdays which either answers your question, or to set up a further meeting to discuss your request. You, in turn, are also expected to check your university email and our Canvas course regularly and respond in a timely manner.    Course Prerequisites  MATH 156 or MATH 161 or MATH 255 or MATH 271    Course Materials    Textbook  We will use the free open-access text Understanding Linear Algebra by David Austin. You should have access to this textbook during our class meetings. The HTML version ( Read Online ) provides the most interactive experience, and is what will be referenced most often in class.    Canvas  We will use Canvas to organize grades and resources and to send whole class announcements. Canvas can be accessed using your Colorado State University email, and should be checked for communications at least once each week day.    WeBWorK   WeBWorK  is a (free) online homework system that you will use regularly to complete assignments that provide an opportunity for you to practice important skills required for success in this course. WeBWorK provides immediate feedback on your work as well as the chance to attempt problems multiple times.    We are invested in making all course materials as accessible as possible, and are committed to the University's accessibility statement . If you experience any barriers to access, please communicate with me (email, call, or stop by in person) so that we can make improvements.    Course Content and Structure  According to the course catalog, this course covers Linear systems, matrices, subspaces of Euclidean spaces, linear transformations on Euclidean spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors . These topics may sound abstract (and can certainly be presented that way), but also have deep and meaningful applications to the world around us. Our goal will be to understand these topics as mathematical objects, but also give proper attention to their usefulness around us.  The mathematician Carl Cowen said that “no significant use of linear algebra happens without a computer”, so we'll also give attention to developing our ability to deploy linear algebraic thinking to solve realistic problems using a computer. Our daily course meetings will emphasize active learning and a collaborative work environment. Please come to each meeting prepared with any preparatory work, a device to access our course textbook and activities, and a willingness to actively participate.     Assignments, Assessments, and Grades   Learning Objectives  Our assignments and assessments will emphasize the following learning objectives:   I visited an office hour in the first 4 weeks of class.    I can execute the next 2-3 steps of Gaussian elimination by hand that are needed to work toward RREF (and recognize that additional steps are needed to achieve RREF), and identify which row operations were used. (Section 1.2)    I can use information about pivots to make conclusions about the solutions of a system of linear equations, and explain the underlying reasoning (using appropriate terminology) regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions and consistency or inconsistency of a system. (Section 1.4)    I can determine if and how a given vector can be written as a linear combination of a given set of vectors and explain what this means geometrically. (Section 2.1)    I can represent a linear system in three different ways and be able to translate back and forth among the forms: as Ax = b, as a question about linear combinations, and as a question about an augmented matrix (Section 2.2 - Prop 2.2.4)    I can reformulate and answer questions about span in terms of linear combinations, matrix equations, and geometrically. (Section 2.3)    I can reformulate and answer questions about linearly dependent or linearly independent vectors using appropriate computations, and explain the meaning of the results of computations in the language of linear combinations. (Section 2.4)    I can find the matrix of a linear transformation using elementary vectors, apply a transformation to a vector or shape, and compose transformations using matrix multiplication. (Section 2.5)    I can determine if a matrix is invertible, find an inverse, and use inverses to solve matrix equations. (Section 3.1)    I can determine whether or not a set of vectors is a basis for , and give examples and non-examples of bases. (Section 3.2)    I can convert a vector given in the standard basis into a vector in another basis and vice versa. (Section 3.2)    I can find the determinant of a given matrix using cofactor expansion and explain what information this tells us about the invertibility of a matrix. (Section 3.4)    I can find and clearly justify bases for the null space and the column space of a matrix (including why the set of vectors is a basis, i.e., why it is linearly independent and spans the relevant spaces) and thus their dimensions. (Section 3.5)    I can verify that a vector is an eigenvector algebraically and explain what this means about the vector geometrically. (Section 4.1)    I can use the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A to identify its eigenvalues, and then find a basis of eigenvectors for each associated eigenspace and, if there is a basis of eigenvectors for , use such a basis to describe the matrix product . (Section 4.2)       Daily Preparation  Before many class meetings, you will be asked to do some work to help prepare for our time together in class. This will often involve working a few short problems and providing me with feedback on your preparation. These will be graded according to the effort you have put into them rather than correctness.    Online Practice  You will have weekly online practice assignments on WeBWorK  . They will typically be due on Wednesday by 11:59 pm MT. Online practice assignments are an opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. You can attempt a problem as many times as you would like before the due date. I will likely not be available for communication the evening of the due date, so please start early and plan to use help resources when they are available!  Your initial login credentials will be your eID in all lowercase (Username) and your 9-digit student ID (Password). Please change your password after your initial login. If you have issues with logging in, please let me know as soon as possible so you do not fall behind.    Labs  About 6 times throughout the semester, you'll start a lab in class that you'll complete and write up outside of class for a formal grade. Labs are more involved activities that help explore certain topics more deeply. Normally these will be done in groups of 2 or 3 and assigned a single group grade.    Quizzes  We will have weekly proficiency quizzes addressing the list of learning objectives that measure your understanding of certain essential skills you need to build a deep understanding of linear algebra.  Most Fridays, we will have an in-class quiz that assesses a subset of these skills, which will be announced in advance. Each skill will be graded as either P for Proficient or NY for not yet . To earn a P , your solution needs to show all work and explanations, use correct notation, and arrive at a correct answer. In short, your work should be close to perfect. Once you have demonstrated proficiency on a learning target, you do not need to do so again. If you don't demonstrate proficiency on a particular target on a particular quiz, you can try again the next week. I won't provide a lot of detailed feedback because it's very helpful for you to learn to assess your work independently of me. I am happy to talk with you about any of your work on the quizzes. Each target will appear on at least three quizzes. Since you have multiple attempts on each target, there in general will be no makeup quizzes. If you still haven't demonstrated proficiency after your third attempt, you are welcome to talk with me about it. Your grade for this component will be the percentage of the learning targets for which you have demonstrated proficiency.  This is a very important component of our course for the following reasons:   Learning is a process. You will not be penalized if you don't demonstrate proficiency in a skill the first time, but you are expected to do so eventually.    Frequent assessment is good for learning. Think of these quizzes as a tool for learning rather than just assessment.    Keeping up with course material is important. These quizzes will be one way of informing both you and me about your progress in the course.    Knowing the basics well is crucial for tackling more in-depth problems. These targets were chosen because they are fundamental so you should think of them as building blocks. You will have time to practice these skills before, during, and after class, but we will also spend class time using them to tackle substantial problems.       Exams  We will have one in-class midterm approximately half-way through the semester, and one cumulative final exam during finals week.    Midterm  The midterm is tentatively scheduled for Friday, October 17, in class. It will cover topics from the first 6 weeks of class (roughly chapters 1 and 2).    Final  The final exam is scheduled for Monday, December 15 from 11:50am -- 1:50pm, in our normal classroom.  The final will be cumulative, split into two sections corresponding to content covered on the midterm and content not covered on the midterm. We know that it can take time to learn new concepts. Therefore, if your percentage score in the first section exceeds your score on the midterm, we will replace your midterm score with your section score from the final.   In general, makeup midterms will be administered during the final exam, unless you have a University excused absence. We will also consider requests from student case management.       Grades  Overall grade percentages will be calculated based on the following weighting:  Daily Prep ( )  Labs ( )   WeBWorK ( )  Quizzes ( )  Midterm ( )  Final Exam ( )    Letter grades will be assigned according to a scale no stricter than the following:   A     B     C     D     F         Tentative Schedule  Below is a tentative schedule for what topics will be covered when.

Services include a food pantry, a meal-swipe program, pocket pantries, and in-person assistance with navigating federal aid eligibility. The RAH page includes numerous resources as well as county, state and federal programs which are described and linked. Furthermore, please notify the instructor if you are comfortable in doing so.    Classroom Behavior, Respect for Diversity and Inclusion  Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code at the catalog and at the SRC .  We acknowledge that many students have had experiences that have left them feeling excluded from the field of mathematics. We also acknowledge that students from minority groups have been disproportionately impacted. We are making this explicit statement because this unfortunate reality is inconsistent with the truth that you can be successful in mathematics, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We are committed to decolonizing mathematics into a field where every student feels supported in accomplishing the hard work necessary to become better problem solvers. We learn more by listening to diverse perspectives, and we hope you will be ready and willing to share yours in this course.  Here are several resources that highlight the past and current contributions to the mathematics community from underrepresented groups:   Meet A Mathematician    Mathematically Gifted and Black    Lathisms    Indigenous Mathematicians    Spectra    Association for Women in Mathematics    Mathematicians of the African Diaspora       Accommodation for Disabilities  If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class due to a disability or chronic health condition, I will need an accommodation letter from the Student Disability Center (SDC) before they are implemented. Please meet with me during my office hours to give me the letter and\/or to further discuss your needs.  If you do not already have these letters, please contact the SDC as soon as possible to initiate the accommodation process. The SDC is located in room 121 of the TILT building. Contact them at 970-491-6385 or visit the SDC website .    Student Parents\/Guardians\/Caregivers  I realize that student parents\/guardians and caregivers face distinctive challenges in succeeding academically, and I'm committed to supporting those of you who are parents to achieve our course's learning outcomes. If you encounter challenges in meeting course expectations, please contact me as soon as possible. We'll develop a plan together so you can be successful in the course.    Student Case Management   Student case management is available to help students with extenuating life circumstances and connect them with resources. In some cases, after you and I discuss your situation, I may request verifiable documentation for class absences from the SCM office if you request considerations for absences or missed coursework.    Mental Health and Wellness  CSU is a community that cares. You are not alone. CSU Health Network Counseling Services has trained professionals who can help. Your student fees provide access to a wide range of support services. Call Counseling Services at (970) 491-6053, and they will work together with you to find out which services are right for you. Visit counseling services to learn more and mental health resources for additional student mental health and well-being resources. If you are concerned about a friend or peer, use Tell Someone by c alling (970) 491-1350 or visiting Tell Someone to share your concerns with a professional who can discreetly connect the distressed individual with the proper resources. Rams Take Care of Rams. Reach out and ask for help if you or someone you know is having a difficult time.    Religious Observances and Class Attendance  CSU has a legal obligation to accommodate students' absences due to religious observances. For such an accommodation, it is the student's responsibility to complete the Religious Accommodation Request Form at the beginning of each semester and submit the request via the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs website. The Dean of Students will communicate with the instructor regarding the student's absence and the student is instructed to discuss how best to ensure an accommodation related to class conflicts. For religious observances that cannot reasonably be anticipated at the beginning of the semester, students must follow the procedure above as soon as possible after the course conflict is identified. If a student knows that a particular course or section of the course will have multiple conflicts with his or her religious obligations, the student is advised to locate another course section or defer taking the course to a different semester. In the event of a conflict in regards to this policy, individuals may appeal using established CSU procedures. Instructors are advised to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure compliance with CSU's obligations. See more details regarding attendance policies at the catalog .    Discrimination and Harassment  CSU is committed to providing an environment that respects the dignity and worth of every member of its community. CSU strives to create and maintain a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive, and responsible so that each member of the CSU community is treated with dignity and respect and is rewarded for relevant considerations such as ability and performance. CSU has adopted a comprehensive policy to define the types of conduct that are prohibited and to prevent harm arising from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. Conduct that is discriminatory or harmful under the policy inhibits the achievement of the stated goals. All students, faculty, staff, and other persons having business with CSU are expected to know and follow this policy.  Details regarding what is involved in bringing a complaint and the procedures for informal and formal resolution are available from the Office of Support and Safety Assessment for student-to-student behavior and the Office of Equal Opportunity for matters involving non-students such as faculty, staff, affiliates, or visitors and matters involving a student and non-student person. See more details at the catalog .    Academic Integrity and the Honor Code  We learn best together, which is why there is a large amount of collaboration built into our course structure. However, there is a difference between learning together and using someone else's work. If you are wondering if you crossed the line, ask yourself \"Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look like this?\" If not, then you are submitting someone else's work (plagiarism). Copying solutions or statements from the internet wihthout citing your source also constitutes plagiarism. We take academic integrity seriously, so all cases of plagiarized work or cheating will receive a 0 and will be submitted to the SRC.  This course will adhere to the CSU Academic Integrity Policy as found in the Colorado State University General Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course and a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. See more details at the catalog and TILT .    Syllabus Disclaimer  Please be aware that this syllabus is a guideline and is subject to change. The instructor reserves the right to make adjustments to the course schedule, assignments, and grading policies as deemed necessary. Students will be notified of any changes in a timely manner.    "
