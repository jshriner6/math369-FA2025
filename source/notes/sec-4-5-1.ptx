        <p> Suppose that our rental car company rents from two locations
        <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.  We find that 80% of the cars rented from
        location <m>P</m> are returned to <m>P</m> while the other 20% are
        returned to <m>Q</m>.  For cars rented from location <m>Q</m>,
        60% are returned to <m>Q</m> and 40% to <m>P</m>. </p>

        <p> We will use <m>P_k</m> and <m>Q_k</m> to denote the number
        of cars at the two locations on day <m>k</m>.  The following
        day, the number of cars at <m>P</m> equals 80% of <m>P_k</m> and
        40% of <m>Q_k</m>.  This shows that

      <p> Suppose you live in a country with three political parties

	<p> Voters will change parties from one election to the next as
	shown in the figure.  We see that 60% of voters stay with the
	same party.  However, 40% of those who vote for party <m>P</m>
	will vote for party <m>Q</m> in the next election. </p>
