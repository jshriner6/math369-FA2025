                        On the grid below, you may only move vertically/horizontally, and you must move exactly 2 spaces at a time.
                        In groups, determine if it is possible to begin on the "start" square and end on the "finish" square.
                        </p>

                            <shortdescription>Grid with 5 rows and 4 columns. The upper left square is labeled with "Start" and
                                and bottom right square is labeled with "Finish".

                        <p>
                            After some experimenting, you may convince yourself this is not possible. Explaining why 
                            with clarity, however, may be more challenging. One approach would be to change your perspective
                            of the problem. You could shade every other square:
                            <image source="grid-1-shaded.png" width="50%">
                                <shortdescription>Grid with 5 rows and 4 columns. The upper left square is labeled with "Start" and
                                    and bottom right square is labeled with "Finish", and every other square is shaded blue.

                            </image>
                            It is now more obvious why this is not possible: the rules of the game require us to start on a blue
                            square and remain on blue squares. Since the "Finish" square is not blue, it's not possible to land here.
                        </p>

                            With a deeper understanding of the original question, we now have tools to approach related questions
                            more effectively. Using similar reasoning, we can conclude it is not possible for the grid on the 
                            left, but it is possible for the grid on the right.
