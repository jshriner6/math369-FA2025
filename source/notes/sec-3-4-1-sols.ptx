                            The determinant is a numerical property of a matrix that holds a lot of information
                            (e.g., is the matrix invertible, how does it behave as a transformation). We'll develop
                            multiple ways to view the determinant in this section.

                    <statement>
      <p> In this activity, we will find the determinant of some
      simple <m>2\times2</m> matrices and discover some important
      properties of determinants. Use the interactive diagram in the textbook, or this 
      <url href="https://understandinglinearalgebra.org/jsactivities/determinants.html">interactive determinants diagram</url> 
      to help answer the questions below.
      </p>

    

      <p> <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p>
	  Use the diagram to find the determinant of the matrix
	  <m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} -\frac12 \amp 0 \\ 0 \amp 2
	  \end{array}\right]</m>.
	  Along with our previous example, what
	  does this lead you to believe is generally true about 
	  the determinant of a diagonal matrix?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Use the diagram to find the determinant of the matrix
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} 0 \amp 1 \\
	1 \amp 0 \\
	\end{array}\right]</m>.  What is the geometric effect of the
	matrix transformation defined by this matrix?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Use the diagram to find the determinant of the matrix
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} 2 \amp 1 \\
	0 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}\right]</m>.  
	More generally, what do you notice about the determinant of any matrix
	of the form
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} 2 \amp k \\
	0 \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}\right]</m>?  What does this say about the
	determinant of an upper triangular matrix?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Use the diagram to find the determinant of any matrix
	of the form
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} 2 \amp 0 \\
	k \amp 1 \\
	\end{array}\right]</m>.  What does this say about the
	determinant of a 
	lower triangular matrix?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Use the diagram to find the determinant of the matrix
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rr} 1 \amp -1 \\
	-2 \amp 2 \\
	\end{array}\right]</m>.   In general,
	what is the determinant of a matrix whose columns are linearly
	dependent? 
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Consider the matrices
	<me>
	  A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  2 \amp 1 \\
	  2 \amp -1 \\
	  \end{array}\right],~~~
	  B = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  </me>.
	  Use the diagram to find the determinants of <m>A</m>,
	  <m>B</m>, and <m>AB</m>.  What does this suggest is
	  generally true about the 
	  relationship of <m>\det(AB)</m> to <m>\det(A)</m> and
	  <m>\det(B)</m>?
	</p></li>
      </ol></p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
	<p><ol marker="a.">
	  <li><p> The determinant is <m>-1</m> because the vectors are
	  negatively oriented and the rectangle has sides of length
	  <m>\frac12</m> and <m>2</m>.  
	  The determinant of a diagonal matrix seems to be
	  the product of the diagonal entries.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The matrix transformation is a reflection over the
	  line <m>y=x</m> and we see that the determinant is
	  <m>-1</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The determinant will continue to be <m>2</m> for any
	  value of <m>k</m>.  This illustrates the fact that the
	  determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals the product
	  of its diagonal entries.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The same reasoning tells us that this determinant is
	  <m>2</m> and, in fact, the determinant of a lower triangular
	  matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The determinant of this matrix is <m>0</m> because
	  the parallelogram formed by the vector has no area.  This
	  suggests that the determinant of a matrix whose columns are
	  linearly dependent is <m>0</m>.  </p></li>

	  <li><p> We find that <m>\det(A) = -4</m>, <m>\det(B) = 2</m>,
	  and <m>\det(AB) = -8</m>.  This suggests that
	  <m>\det(AB) = \det(A) \det(B)</m>.

                                        We defined <m>\text{det}(A)</m> for a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix, but we could do this similarly 
                            for an <m>n \times n</m> matrix. For example, we could define it as the volume created by positively
                            oriented vectors in three dimensions. However, we'll develop other ways for computing the determinant
                            that are better suited for high dimensions.

                                        For an <m>n \times n</m> triangular matrix <m>T</m>, <m>\text{det}(T)</m> is just the
                                        product of its diagonal entries.

                                    <p>
                                        If <m>\text{det}(A) \lt 0</m>, this tells us that <m>A</m> (as a matrix transformation) reverses
                                        the spatial orientation.

                                        Viewing matrices as transformations, we see that <m>A</m> scales areas by the value 
                                        <m>\text{det}(A)</m>, <m>B</m> scales areas by the value <m>\text{det}(B)</m>, and <m>AB</m> 
                                        scales areas by <m>\text{det}(A) \times \text{det}(B)</m> (when viewed as composition), but also by
                                        <m>\text{det}(AB)</m> (when viewed as a single matrix). This implies

                                            \text{det}(AB) = \text{det}(A) \cdot \text{det}(B)
                                        </me>.
