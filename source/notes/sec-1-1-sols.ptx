        In this activity, we consider sets of linear equations
        having just two unknowns.  In this case, we can graph the
        solutions sets for the equations, which allows us to
        visualize different types of behavior.

      <p> This activity considers sets of equations having three

      using <m>3\times5</m>-inch index cards to represent planes.

	  Is it possible that there are no solutions to two linear

	      No, this is not possible.  Two planes will either
