                            We've defined determinants geometrically as signed areas. This definition is not effective for
                            computation in large dimensions. We will develop two more perspectives in which to view the 
                            determinant.

                            Recall, determinants behave nicely with multiplication:

                                \text{det}(AB) = \text{det}(A) \cdot \text{det}(B)

                    <statement>
      <p> We will investigate the connection between the determinant
      of a matrix and its invertibility using Gaussian elimination.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> Consider the two upper triangular matrices
	<me>
	  U_1 =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	  0 \amp 2 \amp 4 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	  \end{array}\right],~~~
	  U_2 =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	  0 \amp 2 \amp 4 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	</me>
	Which of the matrices <m>U_1</m> and <m>U_2</m> are
	invertible?  What are the determinants <m>\det(U_1)</m> and
	<m>\det(U_2)</m>? 
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Explain why an upper triangular matrix is invertible
	if and only if its determinant is not zero.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> 
	  Let's now consider the matrix
	  <me>
	    A = 
	    \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	    1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	    -2 \amp 2 \amp -6 \\
	    3 \amp -1 \amp 10 \\
	    \end{array}\right]
	  </me> and begin the Gaussian elimination process
	  with a row replacement operation
	  <me>
	    A = 
	    \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	    1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	    -2 \amp 2 \amp -6 \\
	    3 \amp -1 \amp 10 \\
	    \end{array}\right]
	    \sim
	    \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	    1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	    3 \amp -1 \amp 10 \\
	    \end{array}\right]
	    = A_1
	    </me>.
	    What is the relationship between <m>\det(A)</m> and
	    <m>\det(A_1)</m>?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Next we perform another row replacement operation:
	<me>
	  A_1=
	\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	3 \amp -1 \amp 10 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\sim
	\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	0 \amp 2 \amp 4 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	= A_2
	</me>.
	What is the relationship between <m>\det(A)</m> and
	<m>\det(A_2)</m>? 
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Finally, we perform an interchange:
	<me>
	  A_2 =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	0 \amp 2 \amp 4 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp -1 \amp 2 \\
	  0 \amp 2 \amp 4 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  = U
	</me>
	to arrive at an upper triangular matrix <m>U</m>.  What is the
	relationship between <m>\det(A)</m> and <m>\det(U)</m>?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Since <m>U</m> is upper
	triangular, we can compute its determinant, which allows us to
	find <m>\det(A)</m>.  What is <m>\det(A)</m>?  Is <m>A</m>
	invertible?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Now consider the matrix
	<me>
	  A = 
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp -1 \amp 3 \\
	  0 \amp 2 \amp -2 \\
	  2 \amp 1 \amp 3 \\
	  \end{array}\right].
	</me>
	Perform a sequence of row operations to find an upper
	triangular matrix <m>U</m> that is row equivalent to
	<m>A</m>.  Use this to determine <m>\det(A)</m> and whether
	<m>A</m> is invertible.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Suppose we apply a sequence of row operations on a
	matrix <m>A</m> to obtain <m>A'</m>.  Explain why <m>\det(A)
	\neq 0</m> if and only if <m>\det(A') \neq 0</m>.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Explain why an <m>n\times n</m> matrix
	<m>A</m> is invertible if and only if <m>\det(A) \neq 0</m>.
	</p></li>

      </ol></p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
	<p><ol marker="a.">
	  <li><p> The matrix <m>U_1</m> is invertible because we see
	  there is a pivot position in every row and column.  The
	  matrix <m>U_2</m>, however, is not invertible because there
	  is not a pivot position in the third row. Also, <m>\det(U_1)=-4</m>
	  and <m>\det(U_2)=0</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals
	  the product of its diagonal entries.  Consequently, if the
	  determinant of an upper triangular matrix is not zero, then
	  each of its diagonal entries must be nonzero.  In this case,
	  there is a pivot position in every row and every column so
	  that the matrix is invertible.  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Row replacement operations do not change the
	  determinant so <m>\det(A) = \det(A_1)</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> In the same way, <m>\det(A) =
	  \det(A_2)</m>. </p></li> 

	  <li><p> Interchanges change the sign of the determinant so
	  <m>\det(A) = -\det(U)</m>.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> The determinant <m>\det(U) = -4</m> since it is the
	  product of the diagonal entries of <m>U</m>.  This means
	  that <m>\det(A) = 4</m>.  We see that <m>A</m> is invertible
	  because <m>U</m>, which has a pivot position in every row
	  and every column, is invertible.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Beginning with a row replacement operation, we
	  arrive at
	  <me>A_1=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp - 1 \amp 3 \\
	  0 \amp 2 \amp -2 \\
	  0 \amp -3 \amp 3 \\
	  \end{array}\right]</me>.  We next scale the second row by
	  <m>\frac12</m> to obtain
	  <me>A_2=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp - 1 \amp 3 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	  0 \amp -3 \amp 3 \\
	  \end{array}\right]</me>.  Another row replacement operation
	  gives
	  <me>A_3=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp - 1 \amp 3 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right]</me>.  Putting these operations together,
	  we see that <m>\det(A) = 2\det(U) = 0</m>.  In this case,
	  <m>A</m> is not invertible because <m>U</m>, which has a row
	  without a pivot position, is not invertible.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> Performing one of the three row operations either
	  leaves the determinant unchanged (row replacement), changes
	  its sign (interchange), or multiplies it by a nonzero number
	  (scaling).  Therefore, if we begin with a matrix whose
	  determinant is not zero, the determinant remains nonzero
	  after any row operation is applied.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p> If we apply a sequence of row operations to <m>A</m>
	  to find a
	  row equivalent matrix <m>U</m> that is upper triangular, we
	  know that <m>\det(A)\neq0</m> if and only if <m>\det(U) \neq 0</m>.
	  We also know that <m>A</m> is invertible if and only if
	  <m>U</m> is invertible.  Putting these facts together, we
	  conclude that <m>\det(A)\neq 0</m> if and only if <m>A</m> is
	  invertible. </p></li>
