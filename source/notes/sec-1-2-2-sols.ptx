                    <statement>

                            Consider the system
                            <me>

                            Perform the row operation <m>3R_1 + R_2 \to R_2</m>.

					<solution>
						<p>
							The given row operation results in the system
							<me>
                                \begin{alignedat}{3}
                                2x + 4y \amp = \amp 3 \\

						</p>
						<p>
							Note that if we changed the variable names this doesn't fundamentally change our process. The 
							coefficients drive the solution space, but it is important to keep track of their positions
							with respect to different variables. We can do this by using an <term>augmented matrix</term>.
						</p>
						<p>
							As an example, consider the linear system
							<me>
                                \begin{alignedat}{3}
                                -x - 2y +2z \amp = \amp -1 \\
                                2x+4y - z \amp = \amp 5 \\
								x+2y \amp = \amp 3 \\
                                \end{alignedat}
                            </me>
							The corresponding augmented matrix would be 
							<me>
								\left(
								\begin{array}{ccc|c}
								-1 \amp -2 \amp 2 \amp -1 \\
								2 \amp 4 \amp -1 \amp 5 \\
								1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp 3
								\end{array}
								\right)
							</me>
							The sub-matrix to the left of the vertical line is called the <term>coefficient matrix</term>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Row operations on equations extend naturally to row operations on matrices. This is more efficient,
							but we have to remember where the matrices come from in order to accurately interpret meaning.

	  <li><p>
	    The system corresponding to this augmented matrix has

	      \amp x_5 \amp {}={} \amp -1 \\
	      \end{alignedat}
	    </me>
	    since the third row of the augmented matrix does not
	    restrict the solution space.  From here, we see that there
	    are infinitely many solutions:  if we make any choice for
	    the variables <m>x_2</m>, <m>x_4</m>, and <m>x_5</m>, we
	    can find values for <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_3</m> that give a
