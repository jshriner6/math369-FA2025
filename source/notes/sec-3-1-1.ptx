                    <title>Activity: Finding an Inverse Matrix</title>
                    <statement>
	<p>
	  This activity demonstrates a procedure for finding the
	  inverse of a matrix <m>A</m>.

	  <ol marker="a.">
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Suppose that <m>A = \begin{bmatrix}
		3 \amp -2 \\
		1 \amp -1 \\
		\end{bmatrix}
		</m>.  To find an inverse <m>B</m>, we write its columns
		as <m>B = \begin{bmatrix}\bvec_1 \amp \bvec_2
		\end{bmatrix}</m> and require that
		<me>
		  \begin{aligned}
		  AB \amp = I \\
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  A\bvec_1 \amp A\bvec_2
		  \end{bmatrix}
		  \amp = 
		  \begin{bmatrix}
		  1 \amp 0 \\
		  0 \amp 1 \\
		  \end{bmatrix}.
		  \end{aligned}
		</me>
		In other words, we can find the columns of <m>B</m> by
		solving the equations
		<me>
		  A\bvec_1 = \twovec10,~~~
		  A\bvec_2 = \twovec01.
		</me>
		Solve these equations to find <m>\bvec_1</m> and
		<m>\bvec_2</m>.  Then write the matrix <m>B</m> and
		verify that <m>AB=I</m>.  This is enough for us to
		conclude that <m>B</m> is
		the inverse of <m>A</m>.
		<sage>
		  <input>
		  </input>
		</sage>
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Find the product <m>BA</m> and explain why we now know
		that <m>B</m> is invertible and <m>B^{-1}=A</m>.
		
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		What happens when you try to find the inverse of
		<m>C = \begin{bmatrix}
		-2 \amp 1 \\
		4 \amp -2 \\
		\end{bmatrix}</m>?
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <p>
		We now develop a condition that must be satisfied by
		an invertible matrix.
		Suppose that <m>A</m> is an invertible
		<m>n\times n</m> matrix with inverse <m>B</m> and 
		suppose that <m>\bvec</m> is any <m>n</m>-dimensional
		vector. Since <m>AB=I</m>, we have
		<me>
		  A(B\bvec) = (AB)\bvec = I\bvec = \bvec.
		</me>
		This says that the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is
		consistent and that <m>\xvec=B\bvec</m> is a solution.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Since we know that <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is consistent
		for any vector <m>\bvec</m>, what does this say about
		the span of the columns of <m>A</m>?
	      </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>
		Since <m>A</m> is a square matrix,
		what does this say
		about the pivot positions of <m>A</m>? What is the
		reduced row echelon form of <m>A</m>?
	      </p>
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <p>
		In this activity, we have studied the matrices
		<me>
		  A = \begin{bmatrix}
		  3 \amp -2 \\
		  1 \amp -1 \\
		  \end{bmatrix},~~~
		  C = \begin{bmatrix}
		  -2 \amp 1 \\
		  4 \amp -2 \\
		  \end{bmatrix}.
		</me>
		Find the reduced row echelon form of each and explain
		how those forms enable us to conclude that one matrix
		is invertible and the other is not.

	  We'll begin by considering the square matrix

		Describe the solution space to the equation <m>A\xvec

	      <p>
		If you have defined a matrix <c>B</c> in Sage, you can
