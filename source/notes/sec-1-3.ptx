                            Real applications of linear algebra are on very large systems, and require
                            technology to compute with and manipulate. There are many possible tools one could use
                            for this task. We'll work with Sage. The goals of this activity are to

                                    <p>
                                        Introduce ways to access Sage and references when you need help.

                                    <p>
                                        Learn the basic syntax to use Sage.

                                        Use Sage to answer questions we've addressed by hand so far in Chapter 1.
