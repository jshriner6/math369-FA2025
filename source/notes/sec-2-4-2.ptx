                <statement>

                    <p> We would like to develop a means to detect when a set of
      vectors is linearly dependent.  This activity will point the
      way. 
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li ><p> Suppose we have five vectors in <m>\real^4</m> that
	form the columns of a matrix having reduced row echelon form
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
	  \vvec_1 \amp 	  \vvec_2 \amp 	  \vvec_3 \amp
	  \vvec_4 \amp	  \vvec_5 
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp -1 \amp 0 \amp 2 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 0 \amp 3 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>.
	Is it possible to write one of the vectors
	<m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_5</m> as a linear
	combination of the others?  If so, show explicitly how one
	vector appears as a linear combination of some of the other
	vectors.  Is this set of vectors linearly dependent or
	independent? 
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Suppose we have another set of three vectors in
	<m>\real^4</m> that form the columns of a matrix having 
	reduced row echelon form
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  \wvec_1 \amp 	  \wvec_2 \amp 	  \wvec_3 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>.
	Is it possible to write one of these vectors <m>\wvec_1</m>,
	<m>\wvec_2</m>, <m>\wvec_3</m> as a linear

	vector appears as a linear combination of some of the other
	vectors.  Is this set of vectors linearly dependent or
	independent?

	<li><p>
	  By looking at the pivot positions, how can you determine
	  whether the columns of a matrix are linearly dependent or
	  independent?
	</p></li>

	<li><p>
	  If one vector in a set is the zero vector <m>\zerovec</m>,
	  can the set of vectors be linearly independent?
	</p></li>

	<li><p>
	  Suppose a set of vectors in <m>\real^{10}</m> has twelve
	  vectors.  Is it possible for this set to be linearly
	  independent?
	</p></li>
