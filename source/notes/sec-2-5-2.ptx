	  We will explore the composition of matrix transformations by
	  revisiting the matrix transformations from a previous activity.

		Let's begin with the matrix transformation
		<m>T:\real^2\to\real^2</m> that rotates a
		two-dimensional vector <m>\xvec</m> by <m>90^\circ</m>
		to produce <m>T(\xvec)</m>.  We saw in the earlier
		activity that the associated matrix is
		<m>A = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 \amp -1 \\
		1 \amp 0 \\
		\end{bmatrix}
		</m>.
		Suppose that we compose this matrix transformation
		with itself to obtain <m>(T\circ T)(\xvec) =
		T(T(\xvec))</m>, which is the result of rotating
		<m>\xvec</m> by <m>90^\circ</m> twice.

		      Suppose that

		In the previous activity, we imagined a company that
		operates two bakeries.
		We found the matrix transformation
		<m>T:\real^2\to\real^3</m> where
		<m>T\left(\twovec{x_1}{x_2}\right)</m> describes the
		number of cakes, doughnuts, and eclairs when Bakery1
		runs for <m>x_1</m> hours and Bakery 2 runs for
		<m>x_2</m> hours.  The associated matrix is
		<m>A = \begin{bmatrix}
		10 \amp 20 \\
		50 \amp 30 \\
		30 \amp 30 \\
		\end{bmatrix}
		</m>.
	      </p>
	      <p> Suppose now that 
	      <ul>
		<li><p> Each cake requires 4 cups of flour and
		and 2 cups of sugar. </p></li>
		
		<li><p> Each doughnut requires 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of 
		sugar. </p></li>
		
		<li><p> Each eclair requires 1 cup of flour and 2 cups
		of sugar. </p></li>
	      </ul>
	      We will describe a matrix transformation
	      <m>S:\real^3\to\real^2</m> where
	      <m>S\left(\threevec{y_1}{y_2}{y_3}\right)</m> is a
	      two-dimensional vector describing the number of cups of
	      flour and sugar required to make <m>y_1</m> cakes,
	      <m>y_2</m> doughnuts, and <m>y_3</m> eclairs.

		    In a certain time interval, both bakeries
