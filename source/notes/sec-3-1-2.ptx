                    <title>Activity: Gaussian Elmination and Matrix Multiplication</title>
                    <statement>
	<p>
	  This activity explores how the row operations of scaling,
	  interchange, and replacement can be performed using matrix
	  multiplication.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As an example, we consider the matrix
	  <me>
	    A = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	    1 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\
	    2 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	    -1 \amp 2 \amp -1 \\
	    \end{array}\right]
	  </me>
	  and apply a replacement operation that multiplies the first
	  row by <m>-2</m> and adds it to the second row.  Rather than
	  performing this operation in the usual way, we construct a
	  new matrix by applying the desired replacement operation to
	  the identity matrix.  To illustrate, we begin with the
	  identity matrix
	  <me>
	    I = \begin{bmatrix}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{bmatrix}
	  </me>
	  and form a new matrix by multiplying the first row by
	  <m>-2</m> and adding it to the second row to obtain
	  <me>
	    R = \begin{bmatrix}
	    1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	    -2 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{bmatrix}.
	  </me>
	  <ol marker="a.">
	    <li><p>
	      Show that the product <m>RA</m> is the result of
	      applying the replacement operation to <m>A</m>.
	      
	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> Explain why <m>R</m> is invertible and find its
	    inverse <m>R^{-1}</m>.
	    </p></li>
	    
	    <li><p> Describe the relationship between <m>R</m> and
	    <m>R^{-1}</m> and use the connection 
	    to replacement operations to explain why it holds.
	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> Other row operations can be performed using a
	    similar procedure.  For instance, suppose we want to scale
	    the second row of <m>A</m> by <m>4</m>.  Find a matrix
	    <m>S</m> so that <m>SA</m> is the same as that obtained
	    from the scaling operation.  Why is <m>S</m> invertible
	    and what is <m>S^{-1}</m>?
	    
	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> Finally, suppose we want to interchange the first
	    and third rows of <m>A</m>.  Find a matrix <m>P</m>,
	    usually called a <em>permutation matrix</em> that performs
	    this operation.  What is <m>P^{-1}</m>?
	    </p></li>
	      
	    <li><p> The original matrix <m>A</m> is seen to be row
	    equivalent to the upper triangular matrix <m>U</m> by
	    performing three replacement operations on <m>A</m>:
	    <me>
	      A = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	      1 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\
	      2 \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	      -1 \amp 2 \amp -1 \\
	      \end{array}\right]
	      \sim
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	      1 \amp 2 \amp 1 \\
	      0 \amp -4 \amp -4 \\
	      0 \amp 0 \amp -4 \\
	      \end{array}\right] = U.
	      </me>
	      Find the matrices <m>L_1</m>, <m>L_2</m>, and <m>L_3</m>
	      that perform these row replacement operations so that
	      <m>L_3L_2L_1 A = U</m>.  </p></li>
	    
	      <li><p> Explain why the matrix product <m>L_3L_2L_1</m> is
	      invertible and use this fact to write <m>A = LU</m>.  What
	      is the matrix <m>L</m> that you find?  Why do you think we
	      denote it by <m>L</m>?
	      
	      
	      </p></li>
	  </ol>
