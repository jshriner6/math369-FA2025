          <title>Course Content and Structure</title>
          <p>
            According to the course catalog, this course covers <q>Linear systems, matrices, subspaces of Euclidean spaces, 
              linear transformations on Euclidean spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors</q>. These topics may sound abstract
              (and can certainly be presented that way), but also have deep and meaningful applications to the world around
              us. Our goal will be to understand these topics as mathematical objects, but also give proper attention to 
              their usefulness around us. 
          </p>
          <p>
              The mathematician Carl Cowen said that “no significant use of linear algebra happens without a computer”, so we'll also
              give attention to developing our ability to deploy linear algebraic thinking to solve realistic problems using a computer.
              Our daily course meetings will emphasize active learning and a collaborative work environment. Please come to each meeting
              prepared with any preparatory work, a device to access our course textbook and activities, and a willingness to actively
              participate.

            <li>
              <p>
                I visited an <xref ref="item-office-hour" text="custom">office hour</xref> in the first 4 weeks of class. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can execute the next 2-3 steps of Gaussian elimination by hand that are needed to work toward RREF (and recognize that additional steps are needed to achieve RREF), 
                and identify which row operations were used. (Section 1.2)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can use information about pivots to make conclusions about the solutions of a system of linear equations, and explain the underlying reasoning (using appropriate terminology) regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions and consistency or inconsistency of a system. (Section 1.4)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can determine if and how a given vector can be written as a linear combination of a given set of vectors and explain what this means geometrically. (Section 2.1)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                 I can represent a linear system in three different ways and be able to translate back and forth among the forms:  as Ax = b, as a question about linear combinations, and as a question about an augmented matrix (Section 2.2 - Prop 2.2.4) 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can reformulate and answer questions about span in terms of linear combinations, matrix equations, and geometrically. (Section 2.3)

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can reformulate and answer questions about linearly dependent or linearly independent vectors using appropriate computations, and explain the meaning of the results of computations in the language of linear combinations. (Section 2.4)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can find the matrix of a linear transformation using elementary vectors, apply a transformation to a vector or shape, and compose transformations using matrix multiplication.  (Section 2.5)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can determine if a matrix is invertible, find an inverse, and use inverses to solve matrix equations. (Section 3.1)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can determine whether or not a set of vectors is a basis for <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, and give examples and non-examples of bases. (Section 3.2)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can convert a vector given in the standard basis into a vector in another basis and vice versa. (Section 3.2)

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can find the determinant of a given matrix using cofactor expansion and explain what information this tells us about the invertibility of a matrix. (Section 3.4)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can find and clearly justify  bases for the null space and the column space of a matrix (including why the set of vectors is a basis, i.e., why it  is  linearly independent and spans the relevant spaces) and thus their dimensions. (Section 3.5)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can verify that a vector is an eigenvector algebraically and explain what this means about the vector geometrically. (Section 4.1)

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can use the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A to identify its eigenvalues, and then find a basis of eigenvectors for each associated eigenspace and, if there is a basis of eigenvectors for <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, use such a basis to describe the matrix product <m>A\mathbf{x}</m>.

        <title>Daily Preparation</title>
        <p>
          Before many class meetings, you will be asked to do some work to help prepare for our time together in class.  This will often involve working a few short problems and providing me with
          feedback on your preparation. These will be graded according to the effort you have put into them rather than correctness.
        </p>

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Online Practice</title>
        <p> You will have weekly online practice assignments on
          <url href="https://wuzzy.natsci.colostate.edu/webwork2/FA-MATH-369"><webwork /> </url>.
          They will typically be due on Mondays by 11:59 pm MT. Online practice assignments are an opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. 
          You can attempt a problem as many times as you would like before the due date. I will likely not be available for communication the evening of the due date, 
          so please start early and plan to use help resources when they are available!

        <title>Labs</title>
        <p>
          About 6 times throughout the semester, you'll start a <q>lab</q> in class that you'll complete and write up outside of 
          class for a formal grade. Labs are more involved activities that 
          help explore certain topics more deeply. Normally these will be done in groups of 2 or 3 and assigned a single group grade.

        <title>Quizzes</title>
        <p>
          We will have weekly proficiency quizzes addressing the <xref ref="para-objectives" text="custom">list of learning objectives</xref> 
          that measure your understanding of certain essential skills you need to build a deep understanding of linear algebra.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Fridays, we will have an in-class quiz that assesses a subset of these skills, which will be announced in advance.
          Each skill will be graded as either <q>P</q> for  <q>Proficient</q> or <q>NY</q> for <q>not yet</q>.  To earn a <q>P</q>, your solution needs to show all work and explanations, use correct notation, and arrive at a correct answer. In short, your work should be close to perfect.
          Once you have demonstrated proficiency on a learning objective, you do not need to do so again.
          If you don't demonstrate proficiency on a particular objective on a particular quiz, you can try again the next week.  I won't provide a lot of detailed feedback because it's very helpful for you to learn to assess your work independently of me. I am happy to talk with you about any of your work on the quizzes.
          Each objective will appear on three quizzes. Since you have multiple attempts on each objective, there in general will be no makeup quizzes.
          If you still haven't demonstrated proficiency after your third attempt, you are welcome to talk with me about it.
          Your grade for this component will be the percentage of the learning objectives for which you have demonstrated proficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a very important component of our course for the following reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Learning is a process. You will not be penalized if you don't demonstrate proficiency in a skill the first time, but you are expected to do so eventually.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Frequent  assessment is good for learning.  Think of these quizzes as a tool for learning rather than just assessment. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Keeping up with course material is important.  These quizzes will be one way of informing both you and me about your progress in the course.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Knowing the basics well is crucial for tackling more in-depth problems. These targets were chosen because they are fundamental so you should think of them as building blocks.  You will have time to practice these skills before, during, and after class, but we will also spend class time using them to tackle substantial problems.

        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>
          We will have one in-class midterm approximately half-way through the semester, and one cumulative final exam
          during finals week.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Midterm</title>
            <p>
              The midterm is tentatively scheduled for Friday, October 17, in class. It will cover topics from the first
              6 weeks of class (roughly chapters 1 and 2).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Final</title>
            <p>
              The final exam is scheduled for Monday, December 15 from 11:50am -- 1:50pm, in our normal classroom. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The final will be cumulative, split into two sections corresponding to content covered on the midterm and content not covered on the midterm.
              We know that it can take time to learn new concepts. Therefore, if your percentage score in the first section exceeds your score on the midterm, we will replace your midterm score with your section score from the final. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>In general, makeup midterms will be administered during the final exam, unless you have a University excused absence. We will also consider requests from student case management.</em>

        <p>
        Any student who faces challenges securing their food or housing can receive support from the 
        <url href="https://lsc.colostate.edu/slice/community-engagement/rams-against-hunger/">Rams Against Hunger program</url>. 
        Services include a food pantry, a meal-swipe program, pocket pantries, and in-person assistance with navigating 
        federal aid eligibility. The RAH page includes numerous resources as well as county, state and federal programs which 
        are described and linked. Furthermore, please notify the instructor if you are comfortable in doing so.

          <title>Classroom Behavior, Respect for Diversity and Inclusion</title>
          <p>
              Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. 
              Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and 
              sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, 
              color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and 
              gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the 
              student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. 
              Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. 
              For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the student code at 
              <url href="https://catalog.colostate.edu/general-catalog/policies/students-responsibilities/">the catalog</url> 
              and at <url href="https://resolutioncenter.colostate.edu/conduct/">the SRC</url>.

          <p>
              We acknowledge that many students have had experiences that have left them feeling excluded from the field of 
              mathematics. We also acknowledge that students from minority groups have been disproportionately impacted. 
              We are making this explicit statement because this unfortunate reality is inconsistent with the truth that you 
              can be successful in mathematics, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We are 
              committed to decolonizing mathematics into a field where every student feels supported in accomplishing the 
              hard work necessary to become better problem solvers. We learn more by listening to diverse perspectives, 
              and we hope you will be ready and willing to share yours in this course.

          <p>
              If you are a student who will need accommodations in this class due to a disability or chronic health condition, 
              I will need an accommodation letter from the Student Disability Center (SDC) before they are implemented.

          </p>
          <p>
              If you do not already have these letters, please contact the SDC as soon as possible to initiate the 
              accommodation process. The SDC is located in room 121 of the TILT building. Contact them at 970-491-6385 or visit

              and I'm committed to supporting those of you who are parents to achieve our course's learning outcomes. If you 
              encounter challenges in meeting course expectations, please contact me as soon as possible. We'll develop a plan 
              together so you can be successful in the course.

      <paragraphs>
          <title>Religious Observances and Class Attendance</title>
          <p>
          CSU has a legal obligation to accommodate students' absences due to religious observances. For such an accommodation, 
          it is the student's responsibility to complete the Religious Accommodation Request Form at the beginning of each 
          semester and submit the request via the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs website. The Dean of Students 
          will communicate with the instructor regarding the student's absence and the student is instructed to discuss how 
          best to ensure an accommodation related to class conflicts. For religious observances that cannot reasonably be 
          anticipated at the beginning of the semester, students must follow the procedure above as soon as possible after the 
          course conflict is identified. If a student knows that a particular course or section of the course will have multiple 
          conflicts with his or her religious obligations, the student is advised to locate another course section or defer 
          taking the course to a different semester. In the event of a conflict in regards to this policy, individuals may 
          appeal using established CSU procedures. Instructors are advised to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure 
          compliance with CSU's obligations. See more details regarding attendance policies at 
          <url href="https://catalog.colostate.edu/general-catalog/academic-standards/academic-policies/">the catalog</url>.

          <title>Discrimination and Harassment</title>
          <p>
              CSU is committed to providing an environment that respects the dignity and worth of every member of its community. 
              CSU strives to create and maintain a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive, and responsible so that 
              each member of the CSU community is treated with dignity and respect and is rewarded for relevant considerations 
              such as ability and performance. CSU has adopted a comprehensive policy to define the types of conduct that are 
              prohibited and to prevent harm arising from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, 
              domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. Conduct that is discriminatory or harmful under 
              the policy inhibits the achievement of the stated goals. All students, faculty, staff, and other persons having 
              business with CSU are expected to know and follow this policy.

          <title>Academic Integrity and the Honor Code</title>
          <p>
              We learn best together, which is why there is a large amount of collaboration built into our course structure. 
              However, there is a difference between learning together and using someone else's work. If you are wondering if 
              you crossed the line, ask yourself "Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look 
              like this?" If not, then you are submitting someone else's work (plagiarism). Copying solutions or statements 
              from the internet wihthout citing your source also constitutes plagiarism. We take academic integrity seriously,
              so all cases of plagiarized work or cheating will receive a 0 and will be submitted to the SRC.
          </p>
          <p>
              This course will adhere to the CSU Academic Integrity Policy as found in the Colorado State University General 
              Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course 
              and a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. See more details at 
              <url href="https://catalog.colostate.edu/general-catalog/policies/students-responsibilities/#academic-integrity">the catalog</url>
