          <title>Course Content and Structure</title>
          <p>
            According to the course catalog, this course covers <q>Linear systems, matrices, subspaces of Euclidean spaces, 
              linear transformations on Euclidean spaces, eigenvalues, eigenvectors</q>. These topics may sound abstract
              (and can certainly be presented that way), but also have deep and meaningful applications to the world around
              us. Our goal will be to understand these topics as mathematical objects, but also give proper attention to 
              their usefulness around us. 
          </p>
          <p>
              The mathematician Carl Cowen said that “no significant use of linear algebra happens without a computer”, so we'll also
              give attention to developing our ability to deploy linear algebraic thinking to solve realistic problems using a computer.
              Our daily course meetings will emphasize active learning and a collaborative work environment. Please come to each meeting
              prepared with any preparatory work, a device to access our course textbook and activities, and a willingness to actively
              participate.

        <title>Learning Objectives</title>
        <p>
          Our assignments and assessments will emphasize the following learning objectives:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                I visited an <xref ref="item-office-hour" text="custom">office hour</xref> in the first 4 weeks of class. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can execute the next 2-3 steps of Gaussian elimination by hand that are needed to work toward RREF (and recognize that additional steps are needed to achieve RREF), 
                and identify which row operations were used. (Section 1.2)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can use information about pivots to make conclusions about the solutions of a system of linear equations, and explain the underlying reasoning (using appropriate terminology) regarding the existence and uniqueness of solutions and consistency or inconsistency of a system. (Section 1.4)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can determine if and how a given vector can be written as a linear combination of a given set of vectors and explain what this means geometrically. (Section 2.1)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                 I can represent a linear system in three different ways and be able to translate back and forth among the forms:  as Ax = b, as a question about linear combinations, and as a question about an augmented matrix (Section 2.2 - Prop 2.2.4) 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can reformulate and answer questions about span in terms of linear combinations, matrix equations, and geometrically. (Section 2.3)

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can reformulate and answer questions about linearly dependent or linearly independent vectors using appropriate computations, and explain the meaning of the results of computations in the language of linear combinations. (Section 2.4)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can find the matrix of a linear transformation using elementary vectors, apply a transformation to a vector or shape, and compose transformations using matrix multiplication.  (Section 2.5)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can determine if a matrix is invertible, find an inverse, and use inverses to solve matrix equations. (Section 3.1)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can determine whether or not a set of vectors is a basis for <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, and give examples and non-examples of bases. (Section 3.2)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can convert a vector given in the standard basis into a vector in another basis and vice versa. (Section 3.2)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can find the determinant of a given matrix using cofactor expansion and explain what information this tells us about the invertibility of a matrix. (Section 3.4)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can find and clearly justify  bases for the null space and the column space of a matrix (including why the set of vectors is a basis, i.e., why it  is  linearly independent and spans the relevant spaces) and thus their dimensions. (Section 3.5)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can verify that a vector is an eigenvector algebraically and explain what this means about the vector geometrically. (Section 4.1)

              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I can use the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A to identify its eigenvalues, and then find a basis of eigenvectors for each associated eigenspace and, if there is a basis of eigenvectors for <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, use such a basis to describe the matrix product <m>A\mathbf{x}</m>. (Section 4.2)

        <title>Daily Preparation</title>
        <p>
          Before many class meetings, you will be asked to do some work to help prepare for our time together in class.  This will often involve working a few short problems and providing me with
          feedback on your preparation. These will be graded according to the effort you have put into them rather than correctness.
        </p>

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Online Practice</title>
        <p> You will have weekly online practice assignments on
          <url href="https://wuzzy.natsci.colostate.edu/webwork2/FA-MATH-369"><webwork /> </url>.
          They will typically be due on Wednesday by 11:59 pm MT. Online practice assignments are an opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. 
          You can attempt a problem as many times as you would like before the due date. I will likely not be available for communication the evening of the due date, 
          so please start early and plan to use help resources when they are available!

        <title>Labs</title>
        <p>
          About 6 times throughout the semester, you'll start a <q>lab</q> in class that you'll complete and write up outside of 
          class for a formal grade. Labs are more involved activities that 
          help explore certain topics more deeply. Normally these will be done in groups of 2 or 3 and assigned a single group grade.

        <title>Quizzes</title>
        <p>
          We will have weekly proficiency quizzes addressing the <xref ref="para-objectives" text="custom">list of learning objectives</xref> 
          that measure your understanding of certain essential skills you need to build a deep understanding of linear algebra.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Fridays, we will have an in-class quiz that assesses a subset of these skills, which will be announced in advance.
          Each skill will be graded as either <q>P</q> for  <q>Proficient</q> or <q>NY</q> for <q>not yet</q>.  To earn a <q>P</q>, your solution needs to show all work and explanations, use correct notation, and arrive at a correct answer. In short, your work should be close to perfect.
          Once you have demonstrated proficiency on a learning target, you do not need to do so again.
          If you don't demonstrate proficiency on a particular target on a particular quiz, you can try again the next week.  I won't provide a lot of detailed feedback because it's very helpful for you to learn to assess your work independently of me. I am happy to talk with you about any of your work on the quizzes.
          Each target will appear on at least three quizzes. Since you have multiple attempts on each target, there in general will be no makeup quizzes.
          If you still haven't demonstrated proficiency after your third attempt, you are welcome to talk with me about it.
          Your grade for this component will be the percentage of the learning targets for which you have demonstrated proficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a very important component of our course for the following reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Learning is a process. You will not be penalized if you don't demonstrate proficiency in a skill the first time, but you are expected to do so eventually.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Frequent  assessment is good for learning.  Think of these quizzes as a tool for learning rather than just assessment. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Keeping up with course material is important.  These quizzes will be one way of informing both you and me about your progress in the course.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Knowing the basics well is crucial for tackling more in-depth problems. These targets were chosen because they are fundamental so you should think of them as building blocks.  You will have time to practice these skills before, during, and after class, but we will also spend class time using them to tackle substantial problems.

        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>
          We will have one in-class midterm approximately half-way through the semester, and one cumulative final exam
          during finals week.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Midterm</title>
            <p>
              The midterm is tentatively scheduled for Friday, October 17, in class. It will cover topics from the first
              6 weeks of class (roughly chapters 1 and 2).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Final</title>
            <p>
              The final exam is scheduled for Monday, December 15 from 11:50am -- 1:50pm, in our normal classroom. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The final will be cumulative, split into two sections corresponding to content covered on the midterm and content not covered on the midterm.
              We know that it can take time to learn new concepts. Therefore, if your percentage score in the first section exceeds your score on the midterm, we will replace your midterm score with your section score from the final. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>In general, makeup midterms will be administered during the final exam, unless you have a University excused absence. We will also consider requests from student case management.</em>

        <title>Grades</title>
        <p> Overall grade percentages will be calculated based on the following weighting:
          <ul>
              <li> Daily Prep (<m>10\%</m>) </li>
              <li> Labs (<m>15\%</m>) </li>

              <li> Midterm (<m>20\%</m>) </li>
              <li> Final Exam (<m>20\%</m>) </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      
        <p>Letter grades will be assigned according to a scale no stricter than the following:
          <dl>
            <li> <title>A </title> <p><m> [90,100]</m> </p></li>
