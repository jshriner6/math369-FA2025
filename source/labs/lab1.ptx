                    Complete the following exercises in
                    groups of 2 or 3 students including complete explanations of your
                    work.  You should write directly on this handout (if additional pages are necessary, please
                    make sure they are well-organized), and you
                    only need to submit one report to Gradescope.  Make sure you indicate everyone in your group
                    in your submission to Gradescope.

                            Consider the system of linear equations:
                            <me>
                                \begin{alignedat}{4} x &#x26; {}+{} &#x26; 2y &#x26; {}-{} &#x26; z &#x26; {}={} &#x26; 1 \\ 3x &#x26; {}+{} &#x26; 2y &#x26; {}+{} &#x26; 2z &#x26; {}={} &#x26; 7 \\ -x &#x26; &#x26; &#x26; {}+{} &#x26; 4z &#x26; {}={} &#x26; -3 \\\end{alignedat}
                            </me>
                            Write this system as an augmented matrix and use Sage to find a description of the solution space.

                            Shown below is the traffic pattern in the downtown area of
                        a large city.  The figures give the number of cars per hour
                        traveling along each road.  Any car that drives into an
                        intersection must also leave the intersection.  This means that
                        the number of cars entering an intersection in an hour is equal to
                        the number of cars leaving the intersection.

                            A typical problem in thermodynamics is to determine the temperature distribution across a thin plate if you know the temperature around the boundary.
                            Assume, for instance, that the plate represents a cross section of a metal beam with negligible heat flow in the direction perpendicular to the plate.
                            Let <m>T_{1}, \ldots, T_{6}</m> be the temperatures at the six nodes inside the beam.
                            The temperature at a node is approximately the average of the four nearest nodes: for instance,
                            <me>
                                T_{1} = (10 + 15 + T_{2} + T_{4})/4 ~~~\hbox{ or }~~~4T_{1} - T_{2} - T_{4} = 25
                            </me>.

                                In the real world, the approximation becomes better the closer the
                          points are together or as we add more and more into the grid.
  
                            Set up a system of linear equations to find the temperature inside
                            the plate.

                            inside the plate.

                                Helpful Sage hint: If you have a matrix <em>B</em> containing rational entries (e.g.
                            fractions), you can obtain a decimal approximation using <c>B.numerical_approx(digits=4)</c>.
                            You may, of course, change 4 to any other appropriate value.

                            Chemists denote a molecule of water as <m>\text{H}_{2}\text{O}</m>, which means it is composed of two atoms of hydrogen (H) and one atom of oxygen (O).
The process by which hydrogen is burned is described by the chemical reaction
<me>
    x\thinspace \text{H}_{2} + y\thinspace\text{O}_{2} \to z\thinspace \text{H}_{2}\text{O}
</me>
This means that <m>x</m> molecules of hydrogen <m>\text{H}_{2}</m> combine with <m>y</m> molecules of oxygen <m>\text{O}_{2}</m> to produce <m>z</m> water molecules.
The number of hydrogen atoms is the same before and after the reaction; the same is true of the oxygen atoms.
