                    Complete the following exercises in
                    groups of 2 or 3 students including complete explanations of your
                    work.  You should write directly on this handout (if additional pages are necessary, please
                    make sure they are well-organized), and you
                    only need to submit one report to Gradescope.  Make sure you indicate everyone in your group
                    in your submission to Gradescope.
                </p>

                    There is a <url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0Ng">page of Sage cells</url> available for you to use
                    for computation.

                    We're going to use linear algebra to model a bike sharing program,
                    like the one in Fort Collins.  To keep things simple, we're going to
                    imagine there are only two locations, <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, where the bicycles
                    are located.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will assume that bicycles are rented in the morning and returned in
                    the evening according to the following rules:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Of the bikes that are rented from location <m>P</m>, <m>70\%</m> of them are returned to <m>P</m> and the other <m>30\%</m> are returned to <m>Q</m>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Of the bikes that are rented from location <m>Q</m>, <m>40\%</m> of them are returned to <m>Q</m> and the other <m>60\%</m> are returned to <m>P</m>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                All bikes get rented throughout the day.

                        Now we're going to introduce some algebra to help us understand what's going on more generally.
            Suppose that <m>P_{k}</m> is the number of bicycles at <m>P</m> on the morning of day <m>k</m> and <m>Q_{k}</m> is the number of bicycles at <m>Q</m>.

                    <p>
            The next morning, the number of bicycles <m>P_{k+1}</m> at location <m>P</m> will be <m>70\%</m> of <m>P_{k}</m> and <m>60\%</m> of <m>Q_{k}</m>.
            Express this as an algebraic equation for <m>P_{k+1}</m>.
                    </p>

                        Now we'll bundle this together using vectors and matrices.
            We will use the vector <m>\xvec_{k} = \twovec{P_k}{Q_k}</m> to represent the distribution of bicycles on day <m>k</m>.
            Using the equations for <m>P_{k+1}</m> and <m>Q_{k+1}</m> that you just wrote, find a matrix <m>A</m> so that
            <me>
                \xvec_{k+1}= A\xvec_{k}
