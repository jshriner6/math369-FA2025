                    Complete the following exercises in
                    groups of 2 or 3 students including complete explanations of your

                    make sure they are well-organized), and you
                    only need to submit one report to Gradescope.  Make sure you indicate everyone in your group

                    <introduction>
      <p> In this first exercise we will look at several examples of dynamical
      systems and their behavior over time.  If
      <m>P = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      1 \amp -1 \\
      1 \amp 1 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </m>, we note
      that the columns of <m>P</m> form a basis
      <m>\bcal</m> of <m>\real^2</m>.  Given below are several
      matrices <m>A</m> written in the form <m>A=PEP^{-1}</m> for some
      matrix <m>E</m>.  For each matrix, 
	  <ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				state the eigenvalues of
      			<m>A</m>, and describe how the matrix <m>E</m> acts on
				vectors written in the basis <m>\bcal</m>,
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				sketch trajectories (with arrows) on the phase portrait for the matrix <m>A</m> for each of the initial values indicated by dots, and
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<p>
				answer the question provided regarding the system's behavior over time.
			</p>
		</li>
	  </ul>

                <introduction>
      <p> In this exercise, we will consider several ways in which two
      species might interact with one another.  Throughout, we will
      consider two species <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> whose populations in
      year <m>k</m> form a vector <m>\xvec_k=\twovec{R_k}{S_k}</m> and
      which evolve according to the rule
      <me>
	\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k
      </me>.
	</p>
	<p>
		To answer the questions, you will need to refer to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given matrix.

		<p>
			This exercise will illustrate how we can use similar techniques as in the <m>2 \times 2</m> case to analyze
			systems of higher dimension.
		</p>
      <p> The following type of analysis has been used to study the
      population of a bison herd.  We will divide the population of
      female bison into three groups: juveniles who are less than one
      year old; yearlings between one and two years old; and adults
      who are older than two years. </p>

      <sidebyside widths="50% 45%">
	<p> Each year,

	  <li><p> 80% of the juveniles survive to become
	  yearlings. </p></li>

	  adults. </p></li>

	  <li><p> 80% of the adults survive. </p></li>

	  <li><p> 40% of the adults give birth to a juvenile.</p></li>

      <p> By <m>J_k</m>, <m>Y_k</m>, and <m>A_k</m>, we denote the
