                    Complete the following exercises in
                    groups of 2 or 3 students including complete explanations of your
                    work.  You should write directly on this handout (if additional pages are necessary, please
                    make sure they are well-organized), and you
                    only need to submit one report to Gradescope.  Make sure you indicate everyone in your group
                    in your submission to Gradescope.

      <p> We will now look at several more examples of dynamical
      systems.  If
      <m>P = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
      1 \amp -1 \\
      1 \amp 1 \\
      \end{array}\right]
      </m>, we note
      that the columns of <m>P</m> form a basis
      <m>\bcal</m> of <m>\real^2</m>.  Given below are several
      matrices <m>A</m> written in the form <m>A=PEP^{-1}</m> for some
      matrix <m>E</m>.  For each matrix, state the eigenvalues of
      <m>A</m> and sketch a phase portrait for the matrix <m>E</m> on
      the left and a phase portrait for <m>A</m> on the right.
      Describe the behavior of <m>A^k\xvec_0</m> as
      <m>k</m> becomes very large for a typical initial vector
      <m>\xvec_0</m>.

                <statement>
      <p> In this activity, we will consider several ways in which two
      species might interact with one another.  Throughout, we will
      consider two species <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> whose populations in
      year <m>k</m> form a vector <m>\xvec_k=\twovec{R_k}{S_k}</m> and
      which evolve according to the rule
      <me>
	\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k
      </me>.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li>
	  <p> Suppose that
	  <m> A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  0.7 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1.6 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  </m>.

	  <p> Explain why the species do not interact with one
	  another.  Which of the six types of dynamical systems do we
	  have?  What happens to both species after a long time?</p>

	  <p> Explain why <m>S</m> is a beneficial species for <m>R</m>.

	  explain why this describes a predator-prey system.
	  Which of the species is the predator and which is the prey?

                <statement>
      <p> The following type of analysis has been used to study the
      population of a bison herd.  We will divide the population of
      female bison into three groups: juveniles who are less than one
      year old; yearlings between one and two years old; and adults
      who are older than two years. </p>

      <sidebyside widths="50% 45%">
	<p> Each year,
	<ul>
	  <li><p> 80% of the juveniles survive to become
	  yearlings. </p></li>

	  <li><p> 90% of the yearlings survive to become
	  adults. </p></li>

	  <li><p> 80% of the adults survive. </p></li>

	  <li><p> 40% of the adults give birth to a juvenile.</p></li> 
	</ul></p>
	
	<image source="images/eigen-3d-species" />
      </sidebyside>

      <p> By <m>J_k</m>, <m>Y_k</m>, and <m>A_k</m>, we denote the
      number of juveniles, yearlings, and adults in year <m>k</m>.  We
      have
      <me>
	J_{k+1} = 0.4 A_k
      </me>.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> Find similar expressions for <m>Y_{k+1}</m> and
	<m>A_{k+1}</m> in terms of <m>J_k</m>, <m>Y_k</m>, and
	<m>A_k</m>.  </p></li>

	<li><p> As is usual, we write the matrix
	<m>\xvec_k=\threevec{J_k}{Y_k}{A_k}</m>.  Write the matrix
	<m>A</m> such that
	<m>\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k</m> and find its eigenvalues.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> We can write <m>A = PEP^{-1}</m> where the matrices
	<m>E</m> and <m>P</m> are approximately:
	<me>
	  \begin{aligned}
	  E \amp {}={} \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	   1.058 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\
	   0 \amp -0.128 \amp -0.506 \\
	   0 \amp  0.506 \amp -0.128 \\
	   \end{array}\right], \\ \\
	  P \amp {}={} \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	  1 \amp  1 \amp  0 \\
	  0.756 \amp -0.378 \amp   1.486 \\

	  \end{aligned}
	</me>
	Make a prediction about the long-term behavior of
	<m>\xvec_k</m>.  For instance, at what rate does it grow?  For
	every 100 adults, how many juveniles, and yearlings are there?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Suppose that the birth rate decreases so that only 30%
	of adults give birth to a juvenile.  How does this affect the
	long-term growth rate of the herd?
	<sage>
	  <input>
	  </input>
	</sage>
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Suppose that the birth rate decreases further so that
	only 20% of adults give birth to a juvenile.  How does this affect the
	long-term growth rate of the herd?
	<sage>
	  <input>
	  </input>
	</sage>
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Find the smallest birth rate that supports a stable
	population. </p></li>
