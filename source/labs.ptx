    <title>Labs</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Labs are more involved activities that help explore certain topics more deeply. 
        Normally these will be done in groups of 2 or 3 and assigned a single group grade.
        You'll start labs in class and complete a formal write up outside of 
        class.
