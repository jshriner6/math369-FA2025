Is it possible that there are no solutions to two linear equations in three unknowns? Either sketch an example or state a reason why it can't happen.    Is it possible that there is exactly one solution to two linear equations in three unknowns? Either sketch an example or state a reason why it can't happen.    Is it possible that the solutions to four equations in three unknowns form a line? Either sketch an example or state a reason why it can't happen.
