Our approach to learning linear algebra will include the following aspects:       Abstract. We can explore concepts using mathematical objects and definitions.    Computational. We can use technology to combine and compute with mathematical objects in meaningful ways.    Geometric. We can view concepts intuitively and describe how objects are positioned and move in space. A great reference for building this view throughout our course is Essence of linear algebra by 3Blue1Brown.         Setting the Stage   On the grid below, you may only move vertically\/horizontally, and you must move exactly 2 spaces at a time. In groups, determine if it is possible to begin on the \"start\" square and end on the \"finish\" square.   Grid with 5 rows and 4 columns. The upper left square is labeled with \"Start\" and and bottom right square is labeled with \"Finish\".     After some experimenting, you may convince yourself this is not possible. Explaining why with clarity, however, may be more challenging. One approach would be to change your perspective of the problem. You could shade every other square:  Grid with 5 rows and 4 columns. The upper left square is labeled with \"Start\" and and bottom right square is labeled with \"Finish\", and every other square is shaded blue.  It is now more obvious why this is not possible: the rules of the game require us to start on a blue square and remain on blue squares.

  "body": " : Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) (Solutions)    Motivation: RREF       We've found a method for solving linear systems that uses row operations to reduce to an \"easy\" system that has the same solution set. But it's tedious! How can we organize the information for efficient computation?     Augmented Matrices   Consider the system Perform the row operation .    The given row operation results in the system   Note that if we changed the variable names this doesn't fundamentally change our process. The coefficients drive the solution space, but it is important to keep track of their positions with respect to different variables. We can do this by using an augmented matrix .  As an example, consider the linear system The corresponding augmented matrix would be The sub-matrix to the left of the vertical line is called the coefficient matrix .  Row operations on equations extend naturally to row operations on matrices. This is more efficient, but we have to remember where the matrices come from in order to accurately interpret meaning.       Activity: Augmented Matrices and Solution Spaces      Write the augmented matrix for the linear system and perform Gaussian elimination to describe the solution space in as much detail as you can.    Suppose that you have a linear system in the variables and whose augmented matrix is row equivalent to Write the linear system corresponding to this augmented matrix and describe its solution set in as much detail as you can.    Suppose that you have a linear system in the variables and whose augmented matrix is row equivalent to Write the linear system corresponding to this augmented matrix and describe its solution set in as much detail as you can.    Suppose that the augmented matrix of a linear system has the following shape where could be any real number.    How many equations are there in this system and how many variables?   Based on our earlier discussion in Section 1.1, do you think it's most likely that this system has exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions?   Suppose that this augmented matrix is row equivalent to Make a choice for the names of the variables and write the corresponding linear system. Does the system have exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions?         The augmented matrix for this linear system is This corresponds to the system of equations showing that there is a single solution .  The corresponding system of equations is The third equation is satisfied for any values of and . Therefore, we see that the only solution to the system is .  Here, the corresponding system of equations is Since the third equation is not satisfied for any values of and , there are no solutions to the system.  The system corresponding to this augmented matrix has three equations and five variables. Our first guess is there are infinitely many solutions. If we write out the equations corresponding to the augmented matrix, we find since the third row of the augmented matrix does not restrict the solution space. From here, we see that there are infinitely many solutions: if we make any choice for the variables , , and , we can find values for and that give a solution.        Definition: RREF   How do we know a matrix is reduced to the \"easiest\" form?  We say that a matrix is in reduced row echelon form if the following properties are satisfied.   If the entries in a row are all zero, then the same is true of any row below it.    If we move across a row from left to right, the first nonzero entry we encounter is 1. We call this entry the leading entry in the row.    The leading entry in any row is to the right of the leading entries in all the rows above it.    A leading entry is the only nonzero entry in its column.   We call a matrix in reduced row echelon form a reduced row echelon matrix .  The following is an example of a matrix in RREF:     The position of a leading entry in a matrix in RREF is called a pivot position .     Activity: Identifying RREF   Consider each of the following augmented matrices. Determine if the matrix is in reduced row echelon form. If it is not, explain why.                            Because the leading entry in the first row is not a , this is not in reduced row echelon form. If we scale the first row by , however, we have a matrix in reduced row echelon form. We may write the corresponding linear system as which may be rewritten as Since may take on any value, this shows that there are infinitely many solutions.   This matrix is in reduced row echelon form. There is a single solution .   This matrix is technically not in RREF since the leading entry in the last row is not the only nonzero entry in its column. However, doing the operations to change this wont' impact the outcome: there are no solutions since the third equation is .   This is not in reduced row echelon form because the row of zeroes should be at the bottom of the matrix. We also need another interchange so that the leading entry in the second row is to the right of the leading entry in the first row. Once again, there are infinitely many solutions.   This is not in reduced row echelon form because the leading entry in the second and third rows are not the only nonzero elements in their columns. We can use replacement operations to remedy this and see that the system has the single solution .        Practice: Using RREF to Describe Solution Spaces   For each matrix in the previous activity, perform necessary row operations to obtain RREF if it is not already reduced. Then, use the matrix in RREF to describe the solution space of the original system.    Solutions are provided in the previous activity.     Fact: RREF       For any given matrix, there is exactly one RREF matrix that can be computed using row operations. This is useful because it means that if we want to find the solution space of a linear system, we should   Translate our system of equations to an augmented matrix.    Compute the RREF of the augmented matrix.    Interpret the solution space from the matrix in RREF.          Observations: Solution Spaces and Pivots       A linear system is inconsistent exactly when a pivot position appears in the rightmost column of the augmented matrix.  A solution is unique when every column of the coefficient matrix contains a pivot position. Columns containing pivot positions correspond to basic variables of the system.  There are infinitely many solutions when there is a column of the coefficient matrix without a pivot position. Columns not containing pivot positions correspond to free variables of the system.     "

The coefficients drive the solution space, but it is important to keep track of their positions with respect to different variables. We can do this by using an augmented matrix .  As an example, consider the linear system The corresponding augmented matrix would be The sub-matrix to the left of the vertical line is called the coefficient matrix .  Row operations on equations extend naturally to row operations on matrices. This is more efficient, but we have to remember where the matrices come from in order to accurately interpret meaning.   "

Suppose that the augmented matrix of a linear system has the following shape where could be any real number.    How many equations are there in this system and how many variables?   Based on our earlier discussion in Section 1.1, do you think it's most likely that this system has exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions?   Suppose that this augmented matrix is row equivalent to Make a choice for the names of the variables and write the corresponding linear system. Does the system have exactly one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions?         The augmented matrix for this linear system is This corresponds to the system of equations showing that there is a single solution .  The corresponding system of equations is The third equation is satisfied for any values of and . Therefore, we see that the only solution to the system is .  Here, the corresponding system of equations is Since the third equation is not satisfied for any values of and , there are no solutions to the system.  The system corresponding to this augmented matrix has three equations and five variables. Our first guess is there are infinitely many solutions. If we write out the equations corresponding to the augmented matrix, we find since the third row of the augmented matrix does not restrict the solution space. From here, we see that there are infinitely many solutions: if we make any choice for the variables , , and , we can find values for and that give a solution.    "

If the entries in a row are all zero, then the same is true of any row below it.    If we move across a row from left to right, the first nonzero entry we encounter is 1. We call this entry the leading entry in the row.    The leading entry in any row is to the right of the leading entries in all the rows above it.    A leading entry is the only nonzero entry in its column.   We call a matrix in reduced row echelon form a reduced row echelon matrix .

We may write the corresponding linear system as which may be rewritten as Since may take on any value, this shows that there are infinitely many solutions.   This matrix is in reduced row echelon form. There is a single solution .   This matrix is technically not in RREF since the leading entry in the last row is not the only nonzero entry in its column. However, doing the operations to change this wont' impact the outcome: there are no solutions since the third equation is .   This is not in reduced row echelon form because the row of zeroes should be at the bottom of the matrix. We also need another interchange so that the leading entry in the second row is to the right of the leading entry in the first row. Once again, there are infinitely many solutions.   This is not in reduced row echelon form because the leading entry in the second and third rows are not the only nonzero elements in their columns.

Let's focus on the first three vectors and view the matrix as an augmented one: This shows that so it is possible to write one of the vectors as a linear combination of the others. Therefore, the set is linearly dependent.  Applying the same reasoning as in the previous part, we see that we cannot write any of the vectors as a linear combination of the others. Therefore, the set is linearly independent.  The columns of a matrix are linearly independent exactly when there is a pivot position in every column of the matrix.  No, because we can write the zero vector as a linear combination of the other vectors: .  No, because the matrix formed by the vectors would have 12 columns and only 10 rows. There can be at most 10 pivot positions so there are at least two columns without pivot positions.        Facts: Linear Independence       The columns of a matrix are linearly independent exactly when every column contains a pivot position.  Therefore, a linearly independent set of vectors in contains at most vectors.

Edge detection algorithms are useful when, say, we want a robot to locate an object in its field of view. Graphic designers also use these algorithms to create artistic effects.     Full color picture of a canyon wall.    The result of the canyon wall picture after an edge detection algorithm.    A canyon wall in Capitol Reef National Park and the result of an edge detection algorithm.   We will consider a very simple version of an edge detection algorithm to give a sense of how this works. Rather than considering a two-dimensional photograph, we will think about a one-dimensional row of pixels in a photograph. The grayscale values of a pixel measure the brightness of a pixel; a grayscale value of 0 corresponds to black, and a value of 255 corresponds to white.  Suppose, for simplicity, that the grayscale values for a row of six pixels are represented by a vector in :    .   Plot of the six pixels and their gray scale values. The first four are close to black, while the last two are close to white.     "

We will introduce a new basis for with vectors: .  Construct the matrix that relates the standard coordinate system with the coordinates in the basis .  Determine the matrix that converts the representation of in standard coordinates into the coordinate system defined by .   Suppose the vectors are expressed in general terms as . Using the relationship , determine an expression for the coefficient in terms of . What does measure in terms of the grayscale values of the pixels? What does measure in terms of the grayscale values of the pixels?  Now for the specific vector , determine the representation of in the -coordinate system.  Explain how the coefficients in determine the location of the jump in brightness in the grayscale values represented by the vector .    Readers who are familiar with calculus may recognize that this change of basis converts a vector into , the set of changes in . This process is similar to differentiation in calculus. Similarly, the process of converting into the vector adds together the changes in a process similar to integration. As a result, this change of basis represents a linear algebraic version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.     We form the matrix   We find that   We see that so measures the change in brightness between one pixel and its neighbor. Similarly, , which measures another change in brightness.  We compute that   Most of the coefficients that measure changes are relatively small in absolute value. The coefficient , however, which measures the change in brightness between the fourth and fifth pixel, has a large absolute value. This tells us that there is a large change in brightness between the fourth and fifth pixel, which points to an edge in the image.    "

Explain why the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors and is the same as that formed by and .

The determinant of a diagonal matrix seems to be the product of the diagonal entries.  The matrix transformation is a reflection over the line and we see that the determinant is .  The determinant will continue to be for any value of . This illustrates the fact that the determinant of an upper triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.  The same reasoning tells us that this determinant is and, in fact, the determinant of a lower triangular matrix equals the product of its diagonal entries.  The determinant of this matrix is because the parallelogram formed by the vector has no area. This suggests that the determinant of a matrix whose columns are linearly dependent is .  We find that , , and . This suggests that .        Observations: Determinants          We defined for a matrix, but we could do this similarly for an matrix. For example, we could define it as the volume created by positively oriented vectors in three dimensions. However, we'll develop other ways for computing the determinant that are better suited for high dimensions.    For an triangular matrix , is just the product of its diagonal entries.    If , this tells us that (as a matrix transformation) reverses the spatial orientation.    Viewing matrices as transformations, we see that scales areas by the value , scales areas by the value , and scales areas by (when viewed as composition), but also by (when viewed as a single matrix).

We find the following areas.  A square has area 1.  A rectangle has area 6.  The square has side length giving an area of 2.  If we consider the horizontal length as the base, we see that so that the area is 4.  In the same way, we can consider both the base and height to be 2 so that the area is 4.         Explain why the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors and is the same as that formed by and .      If we consider the base to be the length of , then the height, which is the perpendicular distance to its parallel side, is the same in both parallelograms.    "
